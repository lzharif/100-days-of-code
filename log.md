# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 29, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Create function to save biodata into realtime database for @sahabatsehati_id

**Thoughts:** Learning Firebase is a new thing for me. But well, I started to getting used to.

### Day 2: December 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Fixing bugs of @sahabatsehati_id apps that occured in Android Marshmallow version

**Thoughts:** I just realized that Android apps sometimes behave differently in different OS version. Looks like creating test system for Android apps development is a good practice that I have to learned anytime soon.

### Day 3: December 31, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Migrating some libary for @sahabatsehati_id apps, including fixing bugs that occured due to this change.

**Thoughts:** It's a best practice to learn from documentation and example that provided by library user. I learned it the hard way.

### Day 4: January 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learning Firebase Cloud Function for @sahabatsehati_id apps.

**Thoughts:** I just thought to deepen my knowledge on Cloud Function as it's a core function for some of @sahabatsehati_id features

### Day 5: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned an interactive fiction IDE named Twine (twinery.org). This IDE combine the word processor and macros that enable writer to make their story into interactive ones. This IDE even enables me to create IF function for my game book named Entropi.

**Thoughts:** Though Twine provided tools to create Interactive Fiction with ease, I still prefer to release full story in android apps. However, this IDE gives me a good starting point on creating an interactive algorithm.

### Day 6: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I created a model, viewholder, and function to retrieve quiz list for @sahabatsehati_id

**Thoughts:** I realized it's better to plan on what I intend to build instead of dive right into IDE.

### Day 7: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to create messaging apps from [Firebase Code Labs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-android/). I also learned that there's a feature in Android Studio called [Resizable Bitmap](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/draw9patch.html). These material surely useful for me in developing @sahabatsehati_id apps

**Thoughts:** I stumbled upon android library called [ChatKit](https://github.com/stfalcon-studio/ChatKit). Though it's pretty neat, I'll use it later.

### Day 8: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I created a model, viewholder, and function to retrieve chat in @sahabatsehati_id apps, though it's still using dummy data.

**Thoughts:** I intend to add more features in the following days. However, I need to focus more on the core features. Therefore, I can release the MVP faster to a market.

### Day 9: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm adding the feature for user to see other profile page in @sahabatsehati_id apps.

**Thoughts:** Seems like using Fragment in apps give user flowing experience, rather than using activity.

### Day 10: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have finished creating profile seeing for user. I also able to fix bugs in displaying list of quiz using query system.

**Thoughts:** Good artist copy, yet great artist steal! This proverb applies also in Android apps development :)

### Day 11: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm doing machine learning test for my research project, named White Blood Cells Counting System based on Image Processing and Machine Learning. I also learned that Feature Engineering is an essential part in developing an A.I system.

**Thoughts:** For a following week, I gotta do data extraction. Phew, must be a legit thing to do!
