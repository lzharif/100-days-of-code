# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 29, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Create function to save biodata into realtime database for @sahabatsehati_id

**Thoughts:** Learning Firebase is a new thing for me. But well, I started to getting used to.

### Day 2: December 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Fixing bugs of @sahabatsehati_id apps that occured in Android Marshmallow version

**Thoughts:** I just realized that Android apps sometimes behave differently in different OS version. Looks like creating test system for Android apps development is a good practice that I have to learned anytime soon.

### Day 3: December 31, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Migrating some libary for @sahabatsehati_id apps, including fixing bugs that occured due to this change.

**Thoughts:** It's a best practice to learn from documentation and example that provided by library user. I learned it the hard way.

### Day 4: January 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learning Firebase Cloud Function for @sahabatsehati_id apps.

**Thoughts:** I just thought to deepen my knowledge on Cloud Function as it's a core function for some of @sahabatsehati_id features

### Day 5: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned an interactive fiction IDE named Twine (twinery.org). This IDE combine the word processor and macros that enable writer to make their story into interactive ones. This IDE even enables me to create IF function for my game book named Entropi.

**Thoughts:** Though Twine provided tools to create Interactive Fiction with ease, I still prefer to release full story in android apps. However, this IDE gives me a good starting point on creating an interactive algorithm.

### Day 6: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I created a model, viewholder, and function to retrieve quiz list for @sahabatsehati_id

**Thoughts:** I realized it's better to plan on what I intend to build instead of dive right into IDE.

### Day 7: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to create messaging apps from [Firebase Code Labs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-android/). I also learned that there's a feature in Android Studio called [Resizable Bitmap](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/draw9patch.html). These material surely useful for me in developing @sahabatsehati_id apps

**Thoughts:** I stumbled upon android library called [ChatKit](https://github.com/stfalcon-studio/ChatKit). Though it's pretty neat, I'll use it later.

### Day 8: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I created a model, viewholder, and function to retrieve chat in @sahabatsehati_id apps, though it's still using dummy data.

**Thoughts:** I intend to add more features in the following days. However, I need to focus more on the core features. Therefore, I can release the MVP faster to a market.

### Day 9: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm adding the feature for user to see other profile page in @sahabatsehati_id apps.

**Thoughts:** Seems like using Fragment in apps give user flowing experience, rather than using activity.

### Day 10: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have finished creating profile seeing for user. I also able to fix bugs in displaying list of quiz using query system.

**Thoughts:** Good artist copy, yet great artist steal! This proverb applies also in Android apps development :)

### Day 11: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm doing machine learning test for my research project, named White Blood Cells Counting System based on Image Processing and Machine Learning. I also learned that Feature Engineering is an essential part in developing an A.I system. Source [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-feature-engineering-part-1-continuous-numeric-data-da4e47099a7b)

**Thoughts:** For a following week, I gotta do data extraction. Phew, must be a legit thing to do!

### Day 12: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm doing data extraction for my research project. I also fixing a flow of registration in @sahabatsehati_id apps.

**Thoughts:** Looks like I need to focus more on sharpen my current skills: Machine Learning, Android Developer, and SEO.

### Day 13: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned that in this current age of technology, data can provide us with better insight on everything. [This article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/clustering-the-top-1-asset-analysis-in-r-6c529b382b42) provides us with household asset analysis in US using only R.

**Thoughts:** Seems like data scientist is a big job right now.

### Day 14: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm still fixing the flow of registration in @sahabatsehati_id

**Thoughts:** It's quite hard to juggle between responsibilities

### Day 15: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still in a way to fixing the flow of registration in @sahabatsehati_id using fragment.

**Thoughts:** Having sleep deprivation really hinder my ability to think. Hmm..

### Day 16: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm in my way to finish @sahabatsehati_id quiz feature. Still confused on how to download array from Firebase Database..

**Thoughts:** It's the matter of ready or not to release the application. Just two more features please..

### Day 17: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have finished the 3rd week of [Big Data Integration and Processing by University of California, San Diego](https://www.coursera.org/learn/big-data-integration-processing/home/info). In this section, I learned that quantity of data sources may pose an issue to a big data systems. This problem can be solved by building a schema that can convert in and out data model between sources, and integrate it. I also learned Splunk. Seems like it can be used for my next venture!

**Thoughts:** Having an allergy may hinder my thinking process, so I have to limit my chocolate consumption :(

### Day 18: January 15, 2018

**Thoughts:** It's better to fix bugs ASAP.

### Day 19: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Right now, I try to implement quiz feature into @sahabatsehati_id. Still have no idea on how to integrate calculation method for this feature. Should I use online function? Or just offline?

**Thoughts:** Firebase, easy to use, hard to master

### Day 20: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I added some code for Cidar (Citra Darah) so it can classify new White Blood Cells type named 'Stab'

**Thoughts:** Looks like documentation is a core thing in every coding project..

### Day 21: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I have done creating a method for calculating quiz result. However, it's much easier for me to implement the quiz activity using fragment.

**Thoughts:** There are so many possible ways to reach our destination.

### Day 22: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still tinkering with @sahabatsehati_id quiz features. It looks like a post feature, however I have to create the calculation method locally.

**Thoughts:** Still have no idea on implementing cloud functions. Hmm, maybe later..

### Day 23: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Through countless night, allergy, and cold weather, I managed to bring quiz feature of @sahabatsehati_id into reality! Though it's still local function, it worked like a charm!

**Thoughts:** Perseverance really pays off, for now..

### Day 24: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have finished the 4th week of [Big Data Integration and Processing by University of California, San Diego](https://www.coursera.org/learn/big-data-integration-processing/home/info).

### Day 29: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I tried to implemented code from [Social-app-android](https://github.com/rozdoum/social-app-android). For now, I choose to log the puk-puk (like) event in different folder on Firebase Database. While it's seems counterproductive, Firebase requires us to [denormalize the database structure](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/structure-data#flatten_data_structures). 

**Thoughts:** While others follow 30 days story, I choose to tell the story for machine. Neat.

### Day 30: January 28, 2018
