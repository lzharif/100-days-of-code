# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 29, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Create function to save biodata into realtime database for @sahabatsehati_id

**Thoughts:** Learning Firebase is a new thing for me. But well, I started to getting used to.

### Day 2: December 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Fixing bugs of @sahabatsehati_id apps that occured in Android Marshmallow version

**Thoughts:** I just realized that Android apps sometimes behave differently in different OS version. Looks like creating test system for Android apps development is a good practice that I have to learned anytime soon.

### Day 3: December 31, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Migrating some libary for @sahabatsehati_id apps, including fixing bugs that occured due to this change.

**Thoughts:** It's a best practice to learn from documentation and example that provided by library user. I learned it the hard way.

### Day 4: January 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learning Firebase Cloud Function for @sahabatsehati_id apps.

**Thoughts:** I just thought to deepen my knowledge on Cloud Function as it's a core function for some of @sahabatsehati_id features

### Day 5: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned an interactive fiction IDE named Twine (twinery.org). This IDE combine the word processor and macros that enable writer to make their story into interactive ones. This IDE even enables me to create IF function for my game book named Entropi.

**Thoughts:** Though Twine provided tools to create Interactive Fiction with ease, I still prefer to release full story in android apps. However, this IDE gives me a good starting point on creating an interactive algorithm.
